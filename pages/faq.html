                What does the over/under mean?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sportsbooks set a over/under or a "total", which is the predicted number of points the teams will score
                combined.
                You can bet on whether you think the actual outcome of the game will fall "under" the predicted "total"
                , or "over" it. If the "total" for the Lakers vs. Suns matchup closed at 188 and the Suns won 107-93,
                the combined 200 points would give "over" bettors a win.
