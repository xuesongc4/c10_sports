                        Our app, like other forms of betting, features three forms of betting for available games. These bets are the <em>spread</em>, the <em>moneyline</em>, and the <em>over/under</em>. Parlays and other forms of compounding bets are not currently supported on our platform.

                        The easiest to understand of the different bets we offer is the <em>moneyline</em>. The <em>moneyline</em> is simply a bet on who will win the game. If you place money on a <em>moneyline</em> bet for a team to win, all you need to win the bet is for that team to win.

                        <em>Spread</em> bets looks much like <em>moneyline</em> bets in that you pick sides based on a team except that it is not as much a pick for a team to win as it is a bet on what the difference in the two teamsâ€™ scores will be. This difference in scores is based on who is favored to win the game and is called the <em>points spread</em>. You can find <em>points spread</em> to the right of home team. For more information on how to read the favored team see the section on favored teams here.

                        In the associated example, the Pittsburgh Steelers are favored to win, and they are favored to win by 7.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Steelers, they would need to beat the Browns by 7.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Browns, they would need to not lose to the Steelers by more than 7.5 points. Since the final score of that game was Steelers 24 and Browns 9, <em>spread</em> bets on the Steelers would have won and <em>spread</em> bets on the Browns would have lost.

                        Over/ under bets are guesses as to whether or not the combined scores of both teams will reach a certain value. The value they need to equal is indicated as a number next to the away team (the team listed on top in American sports). A bet for the <em>over</em> means that both teams need to score more (or over) than the indicated number in order to win the bet. A bet for the <em>under</em> means that both teams need to score less than (or under) the indicated number in order to win the bet.

                    <li>
                        Usually one team is favored to win the game. This is indicated on the primary game screen as a number next to the home team (the bottom team in American sports) called the points spread or simply the spread. A negative spread means that the home team is favored to win by that many points. A positive spread means that the away team is favored to win by that many points.

                    <li>
                        There can be instances when the spread is zero. This just means that the relatively closely matched and are considered to be equally likely to win the game.

                        The <em>odds</em> of a bet are used to determine how much money you will earn if you were to win a bet. The next thing to know is that <em>odds</em> are all based around $100 bets. Some of the numbers associated with <em>odds</em> are positive and some are negative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>odds</em> are positive, for example +150, this means that then based on a $100 bet

                        for a bet read <em>-200</em>, this means that it would take $200 to payout $100
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>odds</em> for a bet read <em>-200</em>, this means that it would take $200 to payout $100
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        so this means that a riskier bet will pay more and a safer bet will pay out less.
