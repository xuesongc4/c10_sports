                    How do these bets work?
                </h3>

                    Our app, like other forms of betting, features three forms of betting for available games. These
                    bets are the <em>spread</em>, the <em>moneyline</em>, and the <em>over/under</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The easiest to understand is the <em>moneyline</em>. The <em>moneyline</em> is simply a bet on
                    who will win the game. If you place money on a <em>moneyline</em> bet for a team to win, all you
                    need to win the bet is for that team to win. Usually one team is favored to win the game. This
                    is indicated on the primary game screen with a negative number located across from the team
                    favored to win.

                <li>
                    The next type of bet is the <em>spread</em>. The <em>spread</em> is similar to the
                    <em>moneyline</em> except it is less of a bet for a team to win as it is for a team to win by a
                    margin. Again the <em>spread</em> is based around who is favored to win which is indicated on
                    the primary game screen with a negative number located across from the team favored to win. The
                    points spread is the value of that negative number by the favored team.

                    In the associated example, the Baltimore Ravens are favored to win, and they are favored to win
                    by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Ravens, they would need to beat the
                    Cleveland Browns by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Browns, they would
                    need to not lose to the Ravens by more than 10.5 points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The final bets are <em>over/under</em> bets. These bets are guesses as to whether or not the
                    combined scores of both teams will reach a certain value. The value they need to equal is
                    indicated next to the team that is not favored. A bet for the <em>over</em> means that both
                    teams need to score over the indicated number in order to win the bet. A bet for the
                    <em>under</em> means that both teams need to score under the indicated number in order to win
                    the bet.
