                    What types of bets can I make?

                <li>
                    Our app, like other forms of betting, features three forms of betting for available games. These
                    bets are the <em>spread</em>, the <em>moneyline</em>, and the <em>over/under</em>.

                    How do <em>moneyline</em> bets work?
                </h3>
                <li>
                    The easiest to understand of the different bets we offer is the <em>moneyline</em>. The <em>moneyline</em> is simply a bet on
                    who will win the game. If you place money on a <em>moneyline</em> bet for a team to win, all you
                    need to win the bet is for that team to win. Usually one team is favored to win the game. This
                    is indicated on the primary game screen as a number next to the home team (the bottom team in American sports. A negative number next to the home team means that the home team is favored to win by that many points. A positive number next to the home team means that the away team is favored to win by that many points.

                <h3>
                    How do <em>spread</em> bets work?
                </h3>
                <li>
                    The <em>spread</em> is similar to the <em>moneyline</em> except it is less of a bet for a team to win as it is for a team to win by a margin. Again the <em>spread</em> is based around who is favored to win which is indicated on the primary game screen with a negative number located across from the team favored to win. The points spread is the value of that negative number by the favored team.

                    In the associated example, the Baltimore Ravens are favored to win, and they are favored to win
                    by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Ravens, they would need to beat the
                    Cleveland Browns by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Browns, they would
                    need to not lose to the Ravens by more than 10.5 points.

                The final bets are <em>over/under</em> bets. These bets are guesses as to whether or not the
                combined scores of both teams will reach a certain value. The value they need to equal is
                indicated next to the team that is not favored. A bet for the <em>over</em> means that both
                teams need to score over the indicated number in order to win the bet. A bet for the
                <em>under</em> means that both teams need to score under the indicated number in order to win
                the bet.
