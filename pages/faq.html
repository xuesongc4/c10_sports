                        Our app, like other forms of betting, features three forms of betting for available games. These bets are the <em>spread</em>, the <em>moneyline</em>, and the <em>over/under</em>. Parlays and other forms of compounding bets are not currently supported on our platform.

                        How do <em>moneyline</em> bets work?
                    </h3>
                    <li>
                        The easiest to understand of the different bets we offer is the <em>moneyline</em>. The <em>moneyline</em> is simply a bet on who will win the game. If you place money on a <em>moneyline</em> bet for a team to win, all you need to win the bet is for that team to win.

                        How do <em>spread</em> bets work?
                    </h3>
                    <li>
                        The <em>spread</em> is similar to the <em>moneyline</em> except it is less of a bet for a team to win as it is for a team to win by a margin. Again the <em>spread</em> is based around who is favored to win which is indicated on the primary game screen across from the home team. The points spread is the value of that number across from the home team.

                        In the associated example, the Baltimore Ravens are favored to win, and they are favored to win by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Ravens, they would need to beat the Cleveland Browns by 10.5 points. In order to win a <em>spread</em> bet on the Browns, they would need to not lose to the Ravens by more than 10.5 points.

                        How do <em>over/under</em> bets work?
                    </h3>
                    <li>
                        Over/ under bets are guesses as to whether or not the combined scores of both teams will reach a certain value. The value they need to equal is indicated as a number next to the away team (the team listed on top in American sports). A bet for the <em>over</em> means that both teams need to score more (or over) than the indicated number in order to win the bet. A bet for the <em>under</em> means that both teams need to score less than (or under) the indicated number in order to win the bet.

                        How do I know who is favored to win a game?
                    </h3>
                    <li>
                        Usually one team is favored to win the game. This is indicated on the primary game screen as a number next to the home team (the bottom team in American sports) called the points spread or simply the spread. A negative spread means that the home team is favored to win by that many points. A positive spread means that the away team is favored to win by that many points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There can be instances when the spread is zero. This just means that the relatively closely matched and are considered to be equally likely to win the game.

                        How do I know what my payout will be?

                        The <em>odds</em> of a bet are used to determine how much money you will earn if you were to win a bet. The next thing to know is that <em>odds</em> are all based around $100 bets. Some of the numbers associated with <em>odds</em> are positive and some are negative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>odds</em> are positive, for example +150, this means that then based on a $100 bet

                        for a bet read <em>-200</em>, this means that it would take $200 to payout $100
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>odds</em> for a bet read <em>-200</em>, this means that it would take $200 to payout $100
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        so this means that a riskier bet will pay more and a safer bet will pay out less.
